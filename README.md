# Difference-Table
Here, Difference table Code of Computer Oriented Numerical Methods in Java Language.While interpolating intermediate value of dependent variable for equi-spaced data of independent variable, at the begining of the table, Newton's Forward Interpolation formula is used. This method relies on Forward Difference Table.
